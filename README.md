## About  
This repository contains the codebase for the **ALX Frontend JavaScript** curriculum and associated exercises/projects. The objective is to deepen understanding of frontend development, especially JavaScript and TypeScript, build reusable components and solid coding practices, and prepare for real-world web development tasks.

---

## Technologies & Tools  
- **JavaScript** — the core scripting language for the browser.  
- **TypeScript** — used for stricter typing and more robust code (per the folder type breakdown).  
- Modern browser APIs and DOM manipulation.  
- (Optional) Build tools / bundlers (if you have them configured).  
- Git + GitHub for version control and collaboration.

---

## Getting Started  
### Prerequisites  
- Node.js (v12 or above) and npm / yarn installed.  
- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) for testing.  
- Basic familiarity with JavaScript/TypeScript and HTML/CSS.  

### Setup  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DAMILOLA8909/alx-frontend-javascript.git  
   ```

2. Change directory into the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd alx-frontend-javascript  
    ```

3. Install any dependencies (if applicable):
    ```bash
    npm install  
    # or  
    yarn install  
    ```

4. Run the project (if a script is configured):
    ```bash
    npm start  
    # or  
    yarn start
    ```

If there’s no start script, open the relevant index.html or run a local server to view the work in the browser.

### Project Structure

Here’s an overview of how this repository is organised:
```java
/ ── README.md
    ── src/            ← source files (JavaScript/TypeScript)
    ── docs/           ← documentation, notes, or links
    ── tests/          ← unit/integration tests (if present)
    ── assets/         ← static assets: images, styles, etc.
    ── dist/ or build/ ← compiled output (if build step exists)
```

**Folder highlights:**

- The 0x04-TypeScript folder suggests work in TypeScript; emphasis is on learning typed code.

- As you progress, you’ll find patterns for good structure: separation of concerns, modular code, and clean directory layout.

---

### Usage

Use this repository to:

- Practice JavaScript fundamentals: variables, functions, classes, asynchronous code, DOM manipulation.

- Transition into TypeScript: interfaces, types, generics, modules.

- Build small frontend components and projects as you move through the ALX curriculum.

- Use as a portfolio or reference for your progression as you transition into an IT/development career.

**Tips**

- Always open code in a modern editor (VS Code recommended) with linting and formatting tools (ESLint, Prettier).

- Break down tasks into smaller modules/functions for clarity and re-usability.

- Write comments where helpful — especially when learning or experimenting.

- Commit often: small, focused commits make it easier to trace changes and learn from mistakes.

- Use branches if you experiment with new features or libraries; keep main clean and stable.

---

### Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you’d like to suggest improvements, corrections, or add features:

1. Fork the repo.

2. Create a feature branch: git checkout -b feature-myNewThing.

3. Make your changes, write clear commit messages.

4. Push to your fork and submit a Pull Request (PR) describing what you changed and why.

5. Ensure adherence to code style, properly test changes if applicable, and maintain documentation updates.
